This is the Youth Weekend 2013 website repository.  After cloning this
repository, run "make install" to build all the HTML files and copy the
miscellaneous blobs to the "output" directory.  Then simply rsync the output
directory to the desired web host.

NOTE: This event has been called 'Youth Weekend West' in the past.  There
hasn't been a Youth Weekend East since 2008, so we dropped the "West" part.
